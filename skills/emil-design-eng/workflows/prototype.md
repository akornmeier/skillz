# Prototype workflow

A prototype is temporary code that answers one explicit question. Choose one branch before writing:

- **Logic, state transitions, or data shape:** read [Logic mode](#logic-mode). Build a small interactive terminal app that exposes difficult cases.
- **Layout, hierarchy, or UI direction:** read [UI mode](#ui-mode). Build structurally different variants on one route with a URL-stable switcher.

If genuinely ambiguous, ask. When the user is unavailable, choose the branch that matches the surrounding code and state the assumption.

- [UI mode](#ui-mode)

## Shared contracts

1. Mark prototype code clearly and place it near the relevant module or page without inventing a new project structure.
2. Provide one command or URL that runs the prototype through the project's existing tooling.
3. Keep state in memory by default; use isolated scratch persistence only when persistence is the question.
4. Add only the tests, error handling, and abstraction needed to run the experiment safely and answer its question. Production standards apply when validated code is promoted.
5. Make relevant state and variant identity visible so the user can explain what changed.
6. Verify the run command, primary interactions, and cleanup path before handoff.
7. After the question is answered, fold the decision into production code through the normal review process. Ask before creating branches, commits, issue comments, or other externally visible records. Do not leave prototype-only routes, switchers, or unsafe shortcuts in production.


## Logic mode

A tiny interactive terminal app that lets the user drive a state model by hand. Use this when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data shape** — the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong once you push it through real cases.

## When this is the right shape

- "I'm not sure if this state machine handles the edge case where X then Y."
- "Does this data model actually let me represent the case where..."
- "I want to feel out what the API should look like before writing it."
- Anything where the user wants to **press buttons and watch state change**.

If the question is primarily visual, return to the branch decision in [shared contracts](#shared-contracts) rather than loading another branch file.

## Process

### 1. State the question

Before writing code, write down what state model and what question you're prototyping. One paragraph, in the prototype's README or a comment at the top of the file. A logic prototype that answers the wrong question is pure waste — make the question explicit so it can be checked later, whether the user is watching now or returning to it AFK.

### 2. Pick the language

Use whatever the host project uses. If the project has no obvious runtime (e.g. a docs repo), ask.

Match the project's existing conventions for tooling — don't add a new package manager or runtime just for the prototype.

### 3. Isolate the logic in a portable module

Put the actual logic — the bit that's answering the question — behind a small, pure interface that could be lifted out and dropped into the real codebase later. The TUI around it is throwaway; the logic module shouldn't be.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer** — `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine** — explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there's no implicit current state — just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns ongoing internal state.

Pick whichever shape best fits the question being asked, _not_ whichever is easiest to wire to a TUI. Keep it pure: no I/O, no terminal code, no `console.log` for control flow. The TUI imports it and calls into it; nothing flows the other direction.

This is what makes the prototype useful past its own lifetime: when the question's been answered, the validated reducer / machine / function set can be lifted into the real module on its own.

### 4. Build the smallest TUI that exposes the state

Build it as a **lightweight TUI** — on every tick, clear the screen (`console.clear()` / `print("\033[2J\033[H")` / equivalent) and re-render the whole frame. The user should always see one stable view, not an ever-growing scrollback.

Each frame has two parts, in this order:

1. **Current state**, pretty-printed and diff-friendly (one field per line, or formatted JSON). Use **bold** for field names or section headers and **dim** for less important context (timestamps, IDs, derived values). Native ANSI escape codes are fine — `\x1b[1m` bold, `\x1b[2m` dim, `\x1b[0m` reset. No need to pull in a styling library unless one is already in the project.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**, listed at the bottom: `[a] add user  [d] delete user  [t] tick clock  [q] quit`. Bold the key, dim the description, or vice-versa — whatever reads cleanly.

Behaviour:

1. **Initialise state** — a single in-memory object/struct. Render the first frame on start.
2. **Read one keystroke (or one line)** at a time, dispatch to a handler that mutates state.
3. **Re-render** the full frame after every action — don't append, replace.
4. **Loop until quit.**

The whole frame should fit on one screen.

### 5. Make it runnable in one command

Add a script to the project's existing task runner (`package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `justfile`, `pyproject.toml`). The user should run `pnpm run <prototype-name>` or equivalent — never need to remember a path.

If the host project has no task runner, just put the command at the top of the prototype's README.

### 6. Hand it over

Give the user the run command. They'll drive it themselves; the interesting moments are when they say "wait, that shouldn't be possible" or "huh, I assumed X would be different" — those are the bugs in the _idea_, which is the whole point. If they want new actions added, add them. Prototypes evolve.

### 7. Capture the answer and clean up

Once the prototype answers its question, record the decision through the project's normal process and apply the production-worthy logic with appropriate tests and error handling. Follow [shared contracts](#shared-contracts) for confirmation and cleanup requirements. Do not create a throwaway branch, commit, or external issue update without approval.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't build a production test suite for the disposable shell.** Add focused tests when they are needed to answer the question or when validated logic is promoted.
- **Don't wire it to the real database.** Use an in-memory store unless the question is specifically about persistence.
- **Don't generalise.** No "what if we wanted to support X later." The prototype answers one question.
- **Don't blur the logic and the TUI together.** If the reducer / state machine references `console.log`, prompts, or terminal escape codes, it's no longer portable. Keep the TUI as a thin shell over a pure module.
- **Don't ship the TUI shell into production.** The shell is optimised for being driven by hand from a terminal. The logic module behind it is the bit worth keeping.


## UI mode

Generate **several radically different UI variations** on a single route, switchable from a floating bottom bar. The user flips between variants in the browser, picks one (or steals bits from each), then throws the rest away.

If the question is primarily about logic or state, return to the branch decision in [shared contracts](#shared-contracts) rather than loading another branch file.

### When UI mode is the right shape

- "What should this page look like?"
- "I want to see a few options for this dashboard before committing."
- "Try a different layout for the settings screen."
- Any time the user would otherwise spend a day picking between three vague mockups in their head.

## Two sub-shapes

Strongly prefer sub-shape A. A UI prototype is much easier to judge when it's **butting up against the rest of the app** — real header, real sidebar, real data, real density. A throwaway route on its own is a vacuum: every variant looks fine in isolation. Default to sub-shape A whenever there's a plausible existing page to host the variants. Only reach for sub-shape B if the prototype genuinely has no nearby home.

### Sub-shape A — adjustment to an existing page (preferred)

The route already exists. Variants are rendered **on the same route**, gated by a `?variant=` URL search param. The existing data fetching, params, and auth all stay — only the rendering swaps. This is the default; pick it unless there's a specific reason not to.

If the prototype is for something that doesn't yet have a page but _would naturally live inside one_ (a new section of the dashboard, a new card on the settings screen, a new step in an existing flow) — that's still sub-shape A. Mount the variants inside the host page.

### Sub-shape B — a new page (last resort)

Only use this when the thing being prototyped genuinely has no existing page to live inside — e.g. an entirely new top-level surface, or a flow that can't be embedded anywhere sensible.

Create a **throwaway route** following whatever routing convention the project already uses — don't invent a new top-level structure. Name it so it's obviously a prototype (e.g. include the word `prototype` in the path or filename). Same `?variant=` pattern.

Before committing to sub-shape B, sanity-check: is there really no existing page this could be embedded in? An empty route hides design problems that a populated one would expose.

In both sub-shapes the floating bottom bar is identical.

## Process

### 1. State the question and pick N

Default to **3 variants**. More than 5 stops being radically different and starts being noise — cap there.

Write down the plan in one line, in the prototype's location or a top-of-file comment:

> "Three variants of the settings page, switchable via `?variant=`, on the existing `/settings` route."

This works whether the user is here to push back or not.

### 2. Generate radically different variants

Draft each variant. Hold each one to:

- The page's purpose and the data it has access to.
- The project's component library / styling system (TailwindCSS, shadcn, MUI, plain CSS, whatever).
- A clear exported component name, e.g. `VariantA`, `VariantB`, `VariantC`.

Variants must be **structurally different** — different layout, different information hierarchy, different primary affordance, not just different colours. Three slightly-tweaked card grids isn't a UI prototype, it's wallpaper. If two drafts come out too similar, redo one with explicit "do not use a card grid" guidance.

### 3. Wire them together

Create a single switcher component on the route:

```tsx
// pseudo-code — adapt to the project's framework
const variant = searchParams.get("variant") ?? "A";
return (
  <>
    {variant === "A" && <VariantA {...data} />}
    {variant === "B" && <VariantB {...data} />}
    {variant === "C" && <VariantC {...data} />}
    <PrototypeSwitcher variants={["A", "B", "C"]} current={variant} />
  </>
);
```

For sub-shape A (existing page): keep all the existing data fetching above the switcher; only the rendered subtree changes per variant.

For sub-shape B (new page): the throwaway route under `/prototype/<name>` mounts the same switcher.

### 4. Build the floating switcher

A small fixed-position bar at the bottom-centre of the screen with three pieces:

- **Left arrow** — cycles to the previous variant (wraps around).
- **Variant label** — shows the current variant key and, if the variant exports a name, that name too. e.g. `B — Sidebar layout`.
- **Right arrow** — cycles forward (wraps around).

Behaviour:

- Clicking an arrow updates the URL search param (use the framework's router — `router.replace` on Next, `navigate` on React Router, etc) so the variant is shareable and reload-stable.
- Keyboard: `←` and `→` arrow keys also cycle. Don't intercept arrow keys when an `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `[contenteditable]` is focused.
- Visually distinct from the page (e.g. high-contrast pill, subtle shadow) so it's obviously not part of the design being evaluated.
- Hidden in production builds — gate on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` or an equivalent check, so a stray prototype merge can't ship the bar to users.

Put the switcher in a single shared component so both sub-shapes can reuse it. Locate it wherever shared UI lives in the project.

### 5. Hand it over

Surface the URL (and the `?variant=` keys). The user will flip through whenever they get to it. The interesting feedback is usually **"I want the header from B with the sidebar from C"** — that's the actual design they want.

### 6. Capture the answer and clean up

Once a variant wins, record which direction was chosen and why through the project's normal process. Follow [shared contracts](#shared-contracts) for confirmation requirements before creating branches, commits, or external issue updates.

- **Sub-shape A** — rebuild or harden the winner in the existing page; remove losing variants and the switcher.
- **Sub-shape B** — promote the direction through normal production implementation; remove the throwaway route and switcher.

Do not promote prototype code unchanged. Add the tests, error handling, accessibility verification, and maintainability expected by the host project.

## Anti-patterns

- **Variants that differ only in colour or copy.** That's a tweak, not a prototype. Real variants disagree about structure.
- **Sharing too much code between variants.** A shared `<Header>` is fine; a shared `<Layout>` defeats the point. Each variant should be free to throw out the layout.
- **Wiring variants to real mutations.** Read-only prototypes are fine. If a variant needs to mutate, point it at a stub — the question is "what should this look like", not "does the backend work".
- **Promoting the prototype directly to production.** The variant code was written under prototype constraints (no tests, minimal error handling). Rewrite it properly when you fold it in.
